Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs involves clear naming conventions, modular design, and proper documentation. In the CRUD Python module, I applied these principles by designing reusable methods for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, making it easy to integrate with the dashboard in Project Two. This approach ensured scalability and flexibility for future projects, such as inventory or customer management systems, and made the codebase easy to understand and enhance.

When approaching a problem, I break it into manageable tasks and apply logical reasoning. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I analyzed client goals, translated them into functional components, and built secure and efficient database interactions. This differed from previous assignments as it required aligning technical solutions with client workflows. In the future, Iâ€™ll prioritize stakeholder feedback and advanced tools to ensure client expectations are met effectively.

Computer scientists solve complex problems by developing systems and tools that address real-world needs. My work on this project enabled Grazioso Salvare to streamline their data management processes, helping them focus on their mission to identify rescue dogs. This highlights how computer science enhances efficiency and empowers organizations to achieve their goals with innovative, data-driven solutions.
